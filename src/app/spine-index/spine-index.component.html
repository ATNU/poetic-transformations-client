  <h2>Spine Index Example</h2>
  <p>This page demonstrates a feature for future releases. A spine index has been automatically generated ahead of time
    using a cosine-similarity measure to compare all lines in all versions and identify lines that are similar enough to be
    considered a match. For this pilot version the cosine-similarity measure deemed acceptable for a match is 0.7. The
    program currently outputs a CSV file listing each spine index with the lines assigned to it. </p>

      The full spine index is shown below, the line IDs are shown on the right, alongside their detected matches M1.1: version M1 line 1 
      <br/>
      The left hand column is the spine index, giving an ID to each of those groups of matching lines so they could be compared accross versions
    </p>
      
    <p>
      A good example is spine index line 5, it moves from line 5 in M1 to line 4, line 10 and eventually line 15 in versions M5 and M6
      <br>
      Some investigation would then be needed to see if this line was being relocated or if it's movment was due to insertions above
